# Threemoji
For people who want to meet new people nearby, Threemoji is a social app that matches individuals with like-minded peers; unlike Tinder, Threemoji matches people based on the three emojis they choose to describe themselves with.

# Planned Features

<br>
Threemoji displays your chats sorted by their last active time. 

You will be automatically matched and a chat will be initiated for you. 

>We are still in the process of defining the meaning of match. Currently, our plan is to categorise the various emoji, where emoji of the same category will be highly similar. Each emoji will have several categories and emoji that share a higher number of similar categories will have a higher level of similarity.

Notifications will prompt you whenever a match happens or when new messages arrive.

Threemoji allows you to see people nearby who were not automatically matched with you.

These people are sorted by the extent of match with you.

You can then start a chat with any of them.

You can change your emoji anytime to match with different people.

If you want to match with people further away, you can change your radius of match.

Chats that are inactive for 3 weeks will be archived and they can be accessed from this side menu.
